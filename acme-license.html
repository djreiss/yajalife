All the free software available on the ACME Labs web site has
a copyright notice like this one:

So what does this legalese mean?
This is a modified version of the BSD license.
You may be more familiar with the Gnu Public License, since
it gets a lot of press.
Well, forget about that.
The BSD license is very different.
While the Gnu license puts all sorts of restrictions on what you
can do with the software, BSD-style licenses say "Hey, do what
you like, we don't care.  Just let people know we wrote it, and
don't sue us."
That's really all there is to it.
The first paragraph with the numbered items says you can do what
you like with the code, as long as you keep our name on it.
The original BSD license has a couple more provisions there,
we got rid of those.
The second paragraph, all in capital letters, is a standard legal
boilerplate notification that tries to make it difficult for anyone
to successfully sue us over the software.

<P>
By the way,
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">FreshMeat</A>
has a nice
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/license-overview.php3">list of different types of freeware licenses</A>.
There are quite a few besides BSD and GPL.
There's also the
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">OpenSource.org</A>
list of
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">open source licenses</A>,
which is not quite the same as the freeware licenses.

<P>
Here are some questions people ask about the license:

<DL>

<DT> "<I>Can I use your software in a freeware product?</I>"
<DD>
Sure.

<DT> "<I>Can I use your software in a commercial product?  Do I have to
pay you?</I>"
<DD>
Yes you can, and no you don't have to, although we certainly won't
object to any checks you care to send our way.

<DT> "<I>If I use your software as part of my product, do I have to
include your source code?  Or <B>my</B> source code?"</I>"
<DD>
No.  You're thinking of the Gnu license.  Our license just says that
<B>if</B> you distribute our source code then you must leave in the license
text; but you are free to use it in binary-only form if you like, and
put the license text in your documentation instead.

<DT> "<I>Can I make my own version of your software?</I>"
<DD>
Of course.

<DT> "<I>Can I <B>distribute</B> my own version of your software?</I>"
<DD>
Yes, although we'd prefer that you didn't.
Having multiple versions of the same thing floating around is
inherently distasteful.
If you absolutely must distribute your own modified version of our
software, please name it something else to avoid confusing people.

<DT> "<I>Would you please send me a signed disclaimer, so my company's
lawyers are happy?</I>"
<DD>
No.
The license in the source code is sufficient.

<DT> "<I>We don't want to put your license in our documentation or distribute
your source, can we use your software anyway?</I>"
<DD>
We occasionally grant special permission for this sort of thing.
A <A HREF="/donate/">donation</A>
to ACME Labs will probably improve the chances.
