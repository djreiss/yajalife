TODO:

- add the new instruction set from avida 2.0

- use dynamic compilation for resources (and later, genome?)

- allow different types of instructions to mutate by different 
  amounts?

Current limitations/bugs:

- let bugs read sensory input -- resources and other bugs nearby
  (partly implemented)

- if a bug does a jump_p into a neighbor, then the neighbor moves
  away, the bug's pointer has to revert back into it's own program

- if no room for a new bug on grid, replace oldest bug with new bug
  (right now, we just don't add the new bug) - make this an option


Additions, new features, more complexity:

- additional actions/capabilities/instructions in Genome

- varying amounts of different resources (forced evolution)

- allow resources to evolve just like the bugs do (or maybe just
  occasionally introduce different populations of resources)... this
  should lead to greater complexity evolving and competition between
  resources and bugs

- "portals" to other worlds, transmit bugs over the network;
  experiment how isolation affects evolution
